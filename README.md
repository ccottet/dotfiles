# Cyril's dot Files

Ma config pour me sentir au chaud Ã  la maison !

### INSTALLATION

Install with the following commands at your own risk.

```zsh
$ git clone git@github.com:ccottet/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
$ ~/.dotfiles/install
```
Once basic installation has proceeded, login & logout to load the environment.
Finally, trigger installation of plugins in vim by opening it and typing the
relevant command:

```
:PlugInstall
```

You're done !
